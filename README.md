# IMAGLE ML App
Wordle but with pictures! A tensorflow model is trained on the Totally Looks Like dataset, which allows it to specialize in image comparison. Imagle then leverages this to allow the user to make guesses with their own pictures, and see if they can get closest to the picture of the day.
